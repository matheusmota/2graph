# 2graph

## About
2graph is a java-based API for abstracting graph databases. 
The API facilitates ETL pipelines and the translation/representation of resources (XML, Spreadsheets, and RDBs ) as graph structures.
The API currently handles connections with [Neo4J](http://neo4j.com) (property graph) and [Virtuoso](http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com) (RDF). See [this discussion](https://matheusmota.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/introducing-2graph-a-java-based-api-for-graph-databases/) for more details about the supported graph databases and graph data models.
